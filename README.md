# NITS-Hacks-7.0

We are planing of creating an advanced disaster management platform aimed at supporting disaster management agencies. The idea is to build a system that gathers real-time data from social media, news sources, and official announcements, using machine learning to identify disaster-related posts.
We will also planning to include video and audio analysis, so we could detect objects or translate important information in multiple languages for emergency responders. 
Another idea is to incorporate satellite mapping with real-time imagery to help teams assess situations visually.
There would also be an SOS system, allowing people to send distress signals via various channels, like SMS or social media, so responders can act quickly. We are considering adding features for relief center inventory and a missing person report system to assist with resource distribution and rescue coordination.

Lastly, We think it would be beneficial to include real-time alerts about weather conditions from trusted government sources, providing timely updates to improve situational awareness during disasters.
