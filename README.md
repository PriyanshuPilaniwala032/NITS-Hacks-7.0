# NITS-Hacks-7.0

We are planing of creating an advanced disaster management platform aimed at supporting disaster management agencies. The idea is to build a system that gathers real-time data from social media, news sources, and official announcements, using machine learning to identify disaster-related posts.
We will also planning to include video and audio analysis, so we could detect objects or translate important information in multiple languages for emergency responders. 
Another idea is to incorporate satellite mapping with real-time imagery to help teams assess situations visually.
There would also be an SOS system, allowing people to send distress signals via various channels, like SMS or social media, so responders can act quickly. We are considering adding features for relief center inventory and a missing person report system to assist with resource distribution and rescue coordination.

Lastly, We think it would be beneficial to include real-time alerts about weather conditions from trusted government sources, providing timely updates to improve situational awareness during disasters.

## Tecnologies to be used
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Algorihms
3. Web Scraping
4. Object Object Detection
5. Speech Analysis
6. Satellite Mapping
7. Drone Configuration

This is our ideation of project, we have started developing our project and will keep updating this repository.

# Development Status

what we have completed:
1. web scraping
2. video analysis(object detection using yolo)
3. machine learning algorithms
4. some part of geospatial and satellite mapping

# Under progress development
1. audio analysis(using whisper and yamlet)
2. sos system
3. inventary management(Using Travelling Salesman Algorithm)
5. SOS System


# NOTE:
We are not using any kind of distinguished web technology based frontend. we have used Ploty Dash (A frameword for dashboard development) so deployment of this dashboard along with all machine learning models is not free. AWS costs a lot thatswhy we are avoiding it!!
